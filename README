BUILDING THE APPLICATION

**Run unit + integration tests: ant -f mybuild.xml test
   This option does not restore the integration database.

**Run unit + integration tests: ant -f mybuild.xml integtest
   This option restores the integration database before and after executing integration tests.

**Create jar: ant -f mybuild.xml jar

**Clean generated artifacts: ant -f mybuild.xml clean

**Restore integration database: ant -f mybuild.xml dbrestore
   This option has not been tested when several users execute it concurrently. 
   This situation may be problematic. Please, use it carefully.

(b) Choose the "Custom-display all possible options" option.
(c) Choose the "Add DROP TABLE / VIEW / PROCEDURE / FUNCTION / EVENT statement"

USING DIFFERENT PERSISTENCE UNITS


Three different persistence units can be used:
   *"classBooker": local DB with embedded DERBY DBMS kept in memory.
   *"classBookerHosted": local DB with hosted DERBY DBMS. You can see
                         the contents of the DB in Netbeans:
                          1.  Services-->Java DB-->Start service
                          2.  Services-->Java DB-->Create DB. 
                                                      Name=ClassBookerDB, 
                                                      user=dbuser, 
                                                      passwd=dbuser
                          3.  Right-click on the created DB-->Connect + execute command  
                              (use SQL commands)
   *"classBookerIntegration": Remote integration DB. MySQL DBMS.
                              This DB should be restored at the end.
