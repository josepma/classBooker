BUILDING THE APPLICATION

**Run unit + integration tests: ant -f mybuild.xml test
   This option does not restore the integration database.

**Run unit + integration tests: ant -f mybuild.xml integtest
   This option restores the integration database before and after executing integration tests.

**Create jar: ant -f mybuild.xml jar

**Clean generated artifacts: ant -f mybuild.xml clean

**Restore integration database: ant -f mybuild.xml dbrestore
   This option has not been tested when several users execute it concurrently. 
   This situation may be problematic. Please, use it carefully.

DUMPING THE INTEGRATION DATABASE

**Instructions to change the database dump file (i.e., DB/sql339811.sql) 

If you generate that file from phpmyadmin, proceed as follows:
(a) Click on the export option.
(b) Choose the "Custom-display all possible options" option.
(c) Choose the "Add DROP TABLE / VIEW / PROCEDURE / FUNCTION / EVENT statement"
(d) Go.

(e) The (c) step will create in the sql instructions of the sort:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS RESERVATION;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS USERT;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ROOM;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BUILDING;

Please, find those instructions throughout the sql339811.sql file, cut them and 
paste them at the beginning of the file IN THE ORDER GIVEN BEFORE. 
There exists an example file in the DB folder. Please, have a look at it. 

(f) Save the dump file as DB/sql339811.sql

USING DIFFERENT PERSISTENCE UNITS


Three different persistence units can be used:
   *"classBooker": local DB with embedded DERBY DBMS kept in memory.
   *"classBookerHosted": local DB with hosted DERBY DBMS. You can see
                         the contents of the DB in Netbeans:
                          1.  Services-->Java DB-->Start service
                          2.  Services-->Java DB-->Create DB. 
                                                      Name=ClassBookerDB, 
                                                      user=dbuser, 
                                                      passwd=dbuser
                          3.  Right-click on the created DB-->Connect + execute command  
                              (use SQL commands)
   *"classBookerIntegration": Remote integration DB. MySQL DBMS.
                              This DB should be restored at the end.

I18N

In order to run the application with a different language. (The default language
is Engilsh). You have to pass a variable to the JVM when the program starts
with the language and the country. The two variables are user.language and 
user.country.
Example:
    -Duser.language=ca -Duser.country=ES

The structure of the files is a NetBeans project, so is highly recomended to
open the project with the NetBeans and run it with it.

Regards.
